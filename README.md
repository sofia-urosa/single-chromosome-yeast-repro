# single-chromosome-yeast-repro

Analytical reproducibility of the computational analyses supporting Shao et al. (2018), verifying transcriptomic stability and chromatin contact structure in the single-chromosome yeast strain.

## Software versions

The following software versions were used:

### Genome assembly and alignment
- Canu **v1.5**
- LAST **v1650**

### Short-read alignment and variant calling
- BWA-MEM **v0.7.17**
- samtools **v1.12**
- bcftools **v1.12**

### RNA-seq analysis
- Bowtie2 **v2.2.2**
- RSEM **v1.3.0**
- R **v3.4.1**
- DESeq2 **v1.16.1**

### Hi-C analysis
- hiclib-legacy (Mirny lab, legacy version)
- Bowtie2 **v2.5.1**
- Python **v3.6**

### Environment management
- Conda / Miniconda
- SLURM workload manager (HPC)

## Repository structure

- `scripts/`  
  Shell, SLURM, and R scripts used to run the analyses.

- `originals/`  
  Raw input data downloaded from public repositories (not tracked in Git).

- `outputs/`  
  Analysis outputs generated by the pipelines (not tracked in Git).

- `envs/`  
  Conda environment YAML files used to manage software dependencies.

- `notebooks/`  
  Supplementary notebooks for exploratory analysis and figure generation.


## How to run
